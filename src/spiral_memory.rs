//! --- Day 3: Spiral Memory ---
//!
//! You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an infinite two-dimensional grid.
//!
//! Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and
//! then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like
//! this:
//!
//! 17  16  15  14  13
//! 18   5   4   3  12
//! 19   6   1   2  11
//! 20   7   8   9  10
//! 21  22  23---> ...
//!
//! While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried
//! back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that
//! can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan
//! Distance between the location of the data and square 1.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! Data from square 1 is carried 0 steps, since it's at the access port.
//! Data from square 12 is carried 3 steps, such as: down, left, left.
//! Data from square 23 is carried only 2 steps: up twice.
//! Data from square 1024 must be carried 31 steps.
//!
//! How many steps are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input
//! all the way to the access port?
//!
//! --- Part Two ---
//!
//! As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in
//! square 1. Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values
//! in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.
//!
//! So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:
//!
//! Square 1 starts with the value 1.
//! Square 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it also stores 1.
//! Square 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 2.
//! Square 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their
//! values, 4.
//! Square 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value 5.
//! Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would
//! receive the following values:
//!
//! 147  142  133  122   59
//! 304    5    4    2   57
//! 330   10    1    1   54
//! 351   11   23   25   26
//! 362  747  806--->   ...
//! What is the first value written that is larger than your puzzle input?
