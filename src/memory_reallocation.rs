//! --- Day 6: Memory Reallocation ---
//!
//! A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation
//! routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.
//!
//! In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks.
//! The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.
//!
//! The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the
//! most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among
//! the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the
//! next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it
//! runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.
//!
//! The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks
//! configuration is produced that has been seen before.
//!
//!
//! For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:
//!
//! The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen
//! for redistribution.
//!
//! Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second
//! bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and
//! second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks
//! like this: 2 4 1 2.
//!
//! Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are
//! four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.
//!
//! Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks.
//! The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three
//! banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.
//!
//! The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks
//! receives one: 1 3 4 1.
//!
//! The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.
//!
//! At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen.
//! The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in
//! this example is 5.
//!
//!
//! Given the initial block counts in your puzzle input, how many redistribution cycles must be
//! completed before a configuration is produced that has been seen before?
//!
