//! --- Day 7: Recursive Circus ---
//!
//! Wandering further through the circuits of the computer, you come upon a tower of programs that
//! have gotten themselves into a bit of trouble. A recursive algorithm has gotten out of hand, and
//! now they're balanced precariously in a large tower.
//!
//! One program at the bottom supports the entire tower. It's holding a large disc, and on the disc
//! are balanced several more sub-towers. At the bottom of these sub-towers, standing on the bottom
//! disc, are other programs, each holding their own disc, and so on. At the very tops of these
//! sub-sub-sub-...-towers, many programs stand simply keeping the disc below them balanced but with
//! no disc of their own.
//!
//! You offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these towers. You ask each
//! program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if they're holding a disc) the names of the
//! programs immediately above them balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your
//! puzzle input). Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the
//! time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.
//!
//! For example, if your list is the following:
//!
//! pbga (66)
//! xhth (57)
//! ebii (61)
//! havc (66)
//! ktlj (57)
//! fwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth
//! qoyq (66)
//! padx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq
//! tknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft
//! jptl (61)
//! ugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl
//! gyxo (61)
//! cntj (57)
//!
//! ...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks like this:
//!
//!              gyxo
//!              /
//!        ugml - ebii
//!       /      \
//!      |         jptl
//!      |
//!      |         pbga
//!      /        /
//! tknk --- padx - havc
//!      \        \
//!      |         qoyq
//!      |
//!      |         ktlj
//!       \      /
//!        fwft - cntj
//!              \
//!              xhth
//!
//!
//! In this example, tknk is at the bottom of the tower (the bottom program), and is holding up
//! ugml, padx, and fwft. Those programs are, in turn, holding up other programs; in this example,
//! none of those programs are holding up any other programs, and are all the tops of their own
//! towers. (The actual tower balancing in front of you is much larger.)
//!
//! Before you're ready to help them, you need to make sure your information is correct. What is
//! the name of the bottom program?
//!
