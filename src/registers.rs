//! --- Day 8: I Heard You Like Registers ---
//! You receive a signal directly from the CPU. Because of your recent assistance with
//! jump instructions, it would like you to compute the result of a series of unusual
//! register instructions.
//!
//! Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase
//! or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a
//! condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register.
//! The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:
//!
//! b inc 5 if a > 1
//! a inc 1 if b < 5
//! c dec -10 if a >= 1
//! c inc -20 if c == 10
//!
//! These instructions would be processed as follows:
//!
//! Because a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.
//! a is increased by 1 (to 1) because b is less than 5 (it is 0).
//! c is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).
//! c is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.
//! After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.
//!
//! You might also encounter <= (less than or equal to) or != (not equal to). However, the
//! CPU doesn't have the bandwidth to tell you what all the registers are named, and leaves
//! that to you to determine.
//!
//! What is the largest value in any register after completing the instructions in your puzzle
//! input?
//!
//! --- Part Two ---
//!
//! To be safe, the CPU also needs to know the highest value held in any register during this
//! process so that it can decide how much memory to allocate to these operations. For example,
//! in the above instructions, the highest value ever held was 10 (in register c after the third
//! instruction was evaluated).
//!
